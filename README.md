# getting-github-trending

this is a repository to get all languages from github trending and list all the repositories according to their languages.

- Develop a REST microservice that list the languages used by the 100 trending public repos on GitHub.
- For every language, you need to calculate the attributes below 👇:
   -Number of repos using this language
   -The list of repos using the language

How to get Trending Repos from Github
Fetching trending repositories simply translates to fetching the most starred repos created in the last 30 days ( from now ). To do that, you'll need to call the following endpoint:
https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=created:>{date}&sort=stars&order=desc

The JSON data from Github will be paginated (you'll receive around 100 repos per JSON page). You can ignore the subsequent pages since you only need the first 100 repositories.
